### Hey there! My name is Olga, I'm a junior frontend developer 👩‍💻

+ I'm currently working on a website for my creative project [*Kocie Nest*](https://www.kocienest.pl/en). I also create landing page projects on request.
+ I'm looking to collaborate on some cool websites where I can gain more experience and improve my coding skills.
+ Aside from web development I love hiking, sewing, crocheting, knitting, dancing the 5Rhythms, learning how to play the ukulele, postcrossing and cats 😸
+ Reach me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/olha-ponomarova)
